## About me

I recently set myself a big goal: to become a top-notch web developer. 

This specialty has been of interest to me for a long time. My education and work have always been associated with it-technologies, I also tried to independently study the front-end and back-end. 

So I hope that my dreams will come true. I will do everything for this.
